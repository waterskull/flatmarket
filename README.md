[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/christophercliff/flatmarket.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/christophercliff/flatmarket) [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/christophercliff/flatmarket/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/christophercliff/flatmarket?branch=master)

Flatmarket is a free, open source e-commerce platform for static websites. It is reliable, secure, and inexpensive to operate.

The platform uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for payment processing and is built on the latest web technologies like [hapi](http://hapijs.com/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

At its core is a batteries-included CLI to help you get started quickly. Modules are also packaged individually so you can customize your rig.

## How it works

The Flatmarket architecture consists of a static website paired with a [proxy server](https://github.com/christophercliff/flatmarket-server) for sending payments to Stripe. The browser and server share a public schema ([represented by a JSON document](https://github.com/christophercliff/flatmarket-schema)) to prevent charge tampering. The store operator can manage inventory and store configuration by updating the schema document.

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](architecture.png)

1. The web browser loads the single-page app from the static file server (e.g. AWS S3).
2. The user submits their credit card information with Stripe Checkout and the web browser obtains a new Stripe token.
3. The web browser sends the token and product ID the Flatmarket server.
4. The Flatmarket server pulls the product information from `flatmarket.json` hosted on the static file server.
5. The Flatmarket server sends the charge to Stripe.

## Live Demo

Take a minute to go try [the live demo](https://christophercliff.com/flatmarket/). Charges can be submitted using credit card number `4242 4242 4242 4242`. A test charge will be created in Stripe, so you should avoid submitting personal information.

## Design goals

- [x] It should cost next-to-nothing to operate.
- [x] It should be reliable and scalable. This is achieved by offloading expensive and complicated operations to third-party services.
- [x] It should be secure.
- [x] It should be easy to customize, update, and deploy.

## Use cases

Flatmarket isn't appropriate for every e-commerce project, but it is uniquely suited for the following situations:

- high traffic but low sales volume.
- high touch, where every transaction requires human involvement.
- sale of digital goods, made-to-order goods, or donations (where stock keeping is not required).
- any situation where low cost is a priority.
